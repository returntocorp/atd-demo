This demonstrates communication using JSON between an OCaml and a
Python program.

Build and run with:
```
$ make
```
(requires atdgen, atdpy, python3, mypy)

Exercise: check what happens if you change the field name `subject` to
`subj` in the interface file `Interface.atd`. Then fix the programs
based on the error messages you get.
